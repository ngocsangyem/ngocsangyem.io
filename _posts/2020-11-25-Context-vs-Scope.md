## Scope

Scope is a function based thing. Scope mean what is the variable access of a function when it is invoked and what is in the variable environment.

## Context

Context on the other hand is more about object based. For example...the value of this keyword which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.

## Summary

- Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of this keyword.
- Scope refers to the visibility of variables.
