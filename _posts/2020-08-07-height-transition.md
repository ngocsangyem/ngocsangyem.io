Transitions an element's height from 0 to auto when its height is unknown.

```html
<div class="trigger">
	Hover me to see a height transition.
	<div class="el">content</div>
</div>
```

```css
.el {
	transition: max-height 0.5s;
	overflow: hidden;
	max-height: 0;
}

.trigger:hover > .el {
	max-height: var(--max-height);
}
```

```javascript
const el = document.querySelector('.el');
const height = el.scrollHeight;

el.style.setProperty('--max-height', height + 'px');
```

##### Demo

#### Explanation

`el.scrollHeight` is the height of the element including overflow, which will change dynamically based on the content of the element.

`el.style.setProperty(...)` sets the `--max-height` CSS variable which is used to specify the max-height of the element the target is hovered over, allowing it to transition smoothly from 0 to auto.
